# Work with the filesystem

## Why do I want to read this?

- Many, many apps you'll build will be about storing and looking up data and hence working with the filesystem.
- At the heart of these apps is the filesystem and your use of it. A poor filesystem layer will spread up throughout your whole system.
- More and more we are storing and reading huge amounts of data, more than we can store in raw form, and traditional databases aren't cutting it. So we need to be smarter and find new ways to store and look up data.
- To fix the problems above, applications often now stream data through commit logs like Kafka and NATs. This chapter will show how to use modern techniques to store and look up data on the filesystem to build a commit log.
- We'll make extensive use of Go APIs you'll use again and again in any application you write.

## What will I learn?

- What are commit logs, how they're different from traditional databases, and why they're increasingly being used to store and look up data. What's going on at the core of services like Kafka and NATs.
- How to use modern techniques to store and look up data on the filesystem efficiently.
- How to use Go's standard library packages to build such a commit log library, with extensive use of its io, bufio, and os packages.

## What will I be able to do that I couldnâ€™t do before?

- Build a well-designed and performant data storage layer in Go.
- How to buffer I/O to improve performance.
- Know what's going on at the heart of systems like Kafka and NATs and diagnose/debug issues such services.

## Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

- We now have a commit log library we can store and look up data with - the heart of our project.
- Next we'll build on that and wrap our library with an API that we can use over a network so people on other computers can use it.
