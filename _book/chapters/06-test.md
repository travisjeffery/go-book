# Test your project

## Why do I want to read this?

Tests improves the reliability of your work and the uptime of your service for your users.

Tests help how efficiently you can make code changes and therefore make progress on your project or business. When you make a change all you should have to do is run your automated tests taking minutes rather than having to manually test everything yourself taking hours.

Tests also make your projects resilient to team member changes since you don't need to communicate the state of the world as it is in your head to them to make them productive.

## What will I learn?

- How to test your services at both unit test and integration test levels.
- How to write integration tests with your gRPC client and server.
- How to test distributed services.

## What will I be able to do that I couldnâ€™t do before?

## Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

- test unit
- test integration against running services
