Your Title

Titles of sections, whether they are chapters or sections within a chapter, should be written in active voice. Instead of a bland noun phrase (such as you might see in an outline), you want something with a little more action. For example, instead of “Moving Backgrounds,” title your section “Create and Install Moving Backgrounds.” Notice that this chapter is entitled, “Create a Story Map,” not the noun phrase “Story Maps.” It’s a subtle difference, but it helps reinforce the notion that you and the reader are doing something.

Why do I want to read this?

Folks today suffer greatly from tl;dr syndrome.1 As a reader, it’s all too easy to simply skip a chapter, or section, because your attention has waned. Motivation is critical for adult learners; simply dumping a bolus of undigested information on an unsuspecting reader guarantees they’ll put the book down and never come back. Instead, you need to resonate with the reader and get them interested—hooked—right off the bat. From the start of the chapter, they should feel that the Fountain of Youth and the Holy Grail are both waiting in the next two pages. Another way of asking this is “What’s in it for me?” or “Why should I care?” Why, indeed?

What will I learn?

What new skill will this material teach you? Notice the difference between the reader-centric story map’s question, What will the reader learn? as opposed to the outline’s simple Here’s what the author knows. You’ve got an idea in mind that you want to convey to the reader. Tell us what that idea is—what this chapter is about. “The reader will learn how to use a wibble.” is not an acceptable answer. How will this make my life easier? What will this do for me and my career? Instead of “learning to use a wibble,” think of it as “learning how to use a wibble to create a holographic web site.” Or whatever.

What will I be able to do that I couldn’t do before?

What’s the benefit to me, the reader? If the answer to this question is “nothing really,” perhaps you should rethink including this chapter at all. Is this necessary background information? Is it really necessary? What is the benefit to the reader at this point? If there’s no tangible, convincing benefit, ditch the chapter or rework it until you have a benefit for the reader. What can you do that you couldn’t do before? Produce something


Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

It’s very easy for a reader to get lost. As attention spans continue to shrink—look, a squirrel!—readers are more and more inclined to skim instead of read thoroughly. Keeping our map metaphor in mind, the reader wants signposts, landmarks, and roadmaps in the text. You need to establish context up front, and keep reminding the reader of where you’ve been and where you’re going on your journey. And just to prove we live by our own words...
