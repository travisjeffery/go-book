# Deploy with Kubernetes

## Why do I want to read this?

We need to deploy our applications so others will be able to use our service. We want our deployments to be fast, efficient, and simple so we can deploy without disrupting our service's uptime. We should be able to deploy as much as we want and without affecting users.

Kubernetes is becoming if not has become the defacto orchestration tool giving you automated deployments, scaling, and management of your appilcations. It is the only such tool available on the 3 major cloud providers: Amazon's AWS, Google GCP, and Microsoft's Azure. This means you can easily switch between the 3 cloud providers, or run across them at the same time, and bargain with them to get better prices.

Learning how to deploy applications also makes programmers more independent rather than leaving it for their ops person to handle, and make yourself more attractive to employers by having a combination of skills that's rare and valuable.

## What will I learn?

How to easily deploy an application using Kubernetes.

## What will I be able to do that I couldnâ€™t do before?

If you've never deployed an application you'll now be able to do so and make your applications available to the world.

If you've deployed before with another tool you'll be able to deploy to every major cloud service the same way, increasing your ability to bargain prices.

## Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

We've deployed our application. People can hit it. We've taken the first step with Kubernetes. Now let's make use of some of the APIs Kubernetes provides to manage our service by writing an operator.
