# Client to server communication with gRPC

## Why do I want to read this?

Everything from your car to your toaster is connected to the internet as we move to the point where all companies are software companies with computers talking over a network. So being able to write networking apps is of utmost importance.

gRPC is an RPC framework created by Google that's becoming more and more popular being used to build all kinds of applications from CRUD apps, to backend data services, to mobile. This chapter will show you how to build a client and server with gRPC.

## What will I learn?

This chapter will show you how to build a client and server with gRPC to make secure, correct, fast clients and servers.

## What will I be able to do that I couldnâ€™t do before?

- How to build network supporting services if you haven't before, how to do so with gRPC specifically.

## Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

We've built a commit log library, wrapped it with a server API and built a client that other people can use. Now we're going to make our service distributed and fault tolerant, so if a server goes down your users aren't affected and can still use your service.
